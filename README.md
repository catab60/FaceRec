</p>

This is a **Face Recognition** software built entirely in Python, featuring a modern GUI, real-time face recognition capabilities, and a training panel that allows users to train their own models with custom datasets or webcam input. The software was developed in 3 non-stop days of focused effort, providing a great learning experience in machine learning, image processing, and GUI design.

This is **Version 1**, and it currently supports real-time face recognition with a training panel that enables users to train models for recognizing multiple people. The software can recognize and differentiate multiple individuals simultaneously and show their positions in real-time. 

### Features:
- **Real-time Face Recognition**: Detect faces and output their positions in real-time.
- **Train Multiple People**: Train the model to recognize multiple people and differentiate them individually.
- **Training Panel**: Train models with custom datasets or webcam input.
- **Modern GUI**: Sleek, user-friendly interface for managing models and recognition tasks.
- **Camera Tracker**: Example use case for real-time camera tracking based on face recognition.
  
## Future Improvements
- **Additional Model Training Features**: Improve flexibility for more datasets.
- **Optimize Real-time Performance**: Speed up recognition for more efficient usage in applications like security and automation.
- **Enhance Multi-face Recognition**: Improve accuracy when recognizing and distinguishing multiple faces at once in real-time.

## Usage Guide

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/catab60/FaceRec
   cd FaceRec
   ```
2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   run install.bat
   ```
3. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   run run.bat
   ```
4. Use the **training panel** to either upload your dataset or connect your webcam to train the model. You can train the model to recognize multiple people and get unique identification for each face.
5. The application will automatically start recognizing faces and output their positions in real-time.

## Learning Experience
This project was a deep dive into face recognition techniques, neural networks, and building a smooth user interface. I gained hands-on experience in integrating machine learning with real-time applications and understanding how face detection models work and can be trained to recognize multiple individuals simultaneously.
